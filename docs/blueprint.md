# **App Name**: Unit Converter

## Core Features:

- Unit Type Selection: Allow users to select the type of unit conversion (Length, Weight, Currency, Time).
- Input Value: Provide an input field for the user to enter the value to be converted.
- Unit Selection: Allow users to select the input and output units for the conversion.
- Conversion Calculation: Automatically convert the input value to the selected output unit.
- Conversion Rate Management: Manage and update the conversion rates.
- Output Display: Display the converted value clearly to the user.
- Currency Conversion Tool: A tool that monitors an external financial site for currency conversion data, and if the site reports a relevant currency changing beyond a reasonable threshold it flags it in the Currency Conversion database for human review. This feature helps maintain the accuracy of the site and prevents stale or maliciously manipulated data from being used.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep teal (#008080) to evoke a sense of knowledge and precision, reminiscent of scientific tools. Avoid direct connection to finances (green).
- Background color: Very light desaturated teal (#E0F8F8) for a clean and unobtrusive backdrop that is easy on the eyes.
- Accent color: Burnt orange (#CC6633) as a complement to the teal. It should add a burst of energy to important user interface elements and calls to action.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, machined look that prioritizes clarity and legibility.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent different unit types (length, weight, currency, time).
- Implement a clean and user-friendly layout with clear input and output sections.
- Use subtle animations when the unit values are updated. For example a scale could tilt one way or another based on if an item gets heavier or lighter
